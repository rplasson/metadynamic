"""
Metadynamic stochastic simulator
================================

Simulation of chemical systems based on Gillespie's Stochastic algorithm, with on-the-fly
creation/destruction of compounds and reactions.


Provides
--------

launch: function for launching a simulation from a .json parameter file, a .hdf5 result file from a
previous run, with eventual additional parameters, and storing the results in a new .hdf5 file.

ResultReader: class for reading and extracting data from a .hdf5 result file.

System: class for creating, running, and directly controlling a simmulation.

Crn: class describing a Chemical Reaction Network.

LOGGER: global object for logging messages

MPI_STATUS: global object for getting information about the MPI status


CLI interaction
---------------

A script named 'metarun' is provided for launching a simulation from the command line.

usage: metarun [-h] [--logdir [logdir]] [--comment [comment]] [--loglevel [loglevel]] [--compress [compress]] parameters
