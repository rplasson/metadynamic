"""Simulation of chemical systems based on Gillespie's Stochastic algorithm.

This package is for modeling metadynamic systems, with on-the-fly creation/destruction of compounds
and reactions.

- A simulation can be simply performed using the function L{launch}, or totally controlled as a
  L{System} object.
- Results can be read from a L{ResultReader} object.
- Chemical reaction networks can be analyzed from L{Crn} objects.
- L{LOGGER} and L{MPI_STATUS} global objects are available for logging and MPI facilities.
