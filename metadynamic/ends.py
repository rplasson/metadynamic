"""General exceptions to be used in metadynamic code.

Exception categories inherit from Finished:
 - L{HappyEnding} is intended for normal end of the computation
 - L{Aborted} is intended to signal that the computation ended earlier than expected,
   but lead to a nonetheless correct result
 - L{BadEnding} is intended to signal that something when wrong during the computation
 - L{InputError} is intended to signal problems with file read or write, unrelated to
   the computation itself.

All exceptions intended to be used are derived from one of these categories, indicating the general
context of the exception.
