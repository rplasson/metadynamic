"""General exceptions to be used in metadynamic code

Exception categories inherit from Finished:
HappyEnding, BadEnding, Aborted, InputError

All exceptions intended to be used are derived from one
of these categories. indicating the general context of the
exception.
 - HappyEnding is intended for normal end of the computation
 - Aborted is intended to signal that the computation ended earlier
   than expected, but lead to a nonetheless correct result
 - HappyEnding is intended to signal that something when wrong during
   the computation
 - InputError is intended to signal problems with file read or write,
   unrekated to the computation itself.
